# .vimrc configuration
My _.vimrc_ file configuration using Plug

## Installation
Clone the repository

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/manuelIsCoding/vimrc-file/new/master
  ```

Overwrite all settings in .vimrc
  ```
  cat vimrc-file/.vimrc > ~/.vimrc
  ```

Maybe you'll need to install [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug "Vim Plug")
and run `:PlugInstall` command in vim for install all plugins.
